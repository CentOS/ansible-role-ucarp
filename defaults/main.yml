# List of Virtual IP Addresses to bind to specific interface
# See https://github.com/jedisct1/UCarp for parameters but following list should help
# example:
# ucarp_vip_list:
#   - vid: 001                    # starting from 1 to 255 , group id for carp protocol
#     interface: eth0             # the interface  on which we'll bind another virtual ip
#     src_address: 192.168.1.1    # existing ip on interface
#     vip_address: 192.168.1.100  # virtual one
#     carp_pass: mypass1          # passwd that will be hashed/exchanged on adv by nodes (not too long)
#   - vid: 002
#     interface: eth1
#     src_address: 172.16.1.1
#     vip_address: 172.16.1.10
#     carp_pass: mypass2
#     advbase: 2                  # Special example : default adverisement interval is 1 but higher value means we can just become "secondary" by default and only "primary" if the one with advbase=1 isn't reachable
